# Adventure Time!
 
 ## Welcome to my third Portfolio Project!
This is my third project (of five) for my full-stack dev. course at [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net) and this time i chose an adventure game. This project is written in Python only, so it's CLI for the win. It runs in the CI mock terminal on [Heroku](www.heroku.com). <br> The user gets to follow Petra around on an adventure and with simple commands guide
her through a series of choices to finally complete the game. The propose of this game is to give the user a fun, positive experience. <br><br> Here is a link to the game can be found [here]()
