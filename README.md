# Adventure Time!
 
 ## Welcome to my third Portfolio Project!
This is my third project (of five) for my full-stack dev. course at [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net) and this time i choose an adventure game.
This project is written in Python only, so it's CLI for the win. The user gets to follow Petra around on an adventure and with simple commands guide
her through a series of choices to finally complete the game. The propose of this game is to give the user a fun, positive experience.
